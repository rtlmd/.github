RTLMD is a simple yet powerful Right to Left Markdown editor designed for users who write in languages that are written from right to left, such as Arabic, Hebrew, Persian, and Urdu. It provides a user-friendly interface for users to write and edit Markdown text in a way that reflects the natural writing direction of their language.

With RTLMD, users can create and edit Markdown files, format text using Markdown syntax, and preview the formatted output in real time. The editor also supports syntax highlighting for popular programming languages, making it a great tool for developers who write code in right-to-left languages.

We are constantly working to improve RTLMD and make it the best Markdown editor for right-to-left languages. If you have any feature requests or bug reports, we would love to hear from you! Please send your feedback to us through [discussions](https://github.com/rtlmd/.github/discussions), and we will do our best to address your concerns and make RTLMD even better.
